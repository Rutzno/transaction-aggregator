# Transaction Aggregator
- We implement a Transaction Aggregator system that apply the fundamentals of inter-service communication using REST APIs (RestTemplate)
- The service depends on other services (two remote servers) to receive necessary data.
- We also implement retry pattern to ensure system resilience and continuity of service even when remote servers are temporarily unavailable.
- Finally, we applied caching to optimize system performance and efficiency.
